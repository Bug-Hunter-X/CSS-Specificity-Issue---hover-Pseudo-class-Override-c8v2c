The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of the `:hover` pseudo-class is not achieved due to incorrect specificity.

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

.container .inner {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: yellow;
}

.container .inner:hover {
  background-color: orange;
}
```

When hovering over the `.inner` element, the `background-color` should change to orange, but it will remain yellow. This is because the selector `.container:hover` has lower specificity than `.container .inner:hover`.  The hover on the inner element isn't triggering its hover style because the parent's hover style is preventing it.  It needs higher specificity to override the parent's style.
